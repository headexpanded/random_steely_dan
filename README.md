# random_steely_dan

A Chrome extension which displays a random Steely Dan lyric snippet at some random time once every few hours. And then tweets it.

This is my first Chrome extension, however...

The Fall will be next. Then Bob Dylan. After him...Bob Marley? David Bowie? Lana Del Ray? The Smiths...?
