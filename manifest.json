/* 
A Chrome extension which puts a random lyric by Steely Dan in a browser notification
HTML, CSS, JS, TS

- the extension sets an alarm every 8 hours
- the alarm event listener calls the getSong function
- getSong selects one of three queries to a HiGraph query object
- (1st 100 results, 2nd 100 results, last 100 results: this is to get around HiGraph's 100 return limit)

- getSong returns a song object, which includes:
  1/ a lyric snippet
  2/ the song from which the lyric snippet is sourced
  3/ the album upon which the song appears

- the song object populates a basic Chrome browser notification with the lyric snippet
- the song object is stored in local storage, over-writing any previous song object

- if the user clicks the extension button:
  1/ the song object is returned from local storage
  2/ an HTML pop-up displays:
    1/ the lyric snippet
    2/ the song from which the lyric snippet is sourced
    3/ the name of the album upon which the song appears
    4/ the cover art of the album
